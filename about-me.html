          <h1>What I did in the past</h1>
          <p>After finishing my Masters degree in Microbiology, I worked in a drug- discovery organisation for 4 years as an Associate research scientist. I was mostly involved in invitro mutagenicity and ecotoxicology studies. I also had a short stint in the Histopathology lab where I assisted in necropsy, processing and quality control of tissue slides.<br>
          After migrating to Australia I did my Cert 3 in Early Childhood education and worked as an educator for a year in an amazing centre in Sydney </p>

          <h1>What I am upto now</h1>
          <p>As a student in Coder Academy doing my Diploma in IT, I am currently learning computer science fundamentals along with HTML/CSS and Ruby. By the end of the course, my skills would include but not be limited to Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, MERN stack - MongoDB ,Express, React, Node.js.<br> Along with technical content, I am also being given the chance to hone my presentation/public speaking skills. I love that I am pushing my boundaries and learning something new everyday. In the process of my career change, I wish to inspire more women, especially mothers, that if there is a will, there is a way! <br>
