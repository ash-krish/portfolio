        <h1>What I did in the past</h1>
        <p>After finishing my Masters degree in Microbiology, I worked in a drug discovery organisation for 4 years as an Associate research scientist. I was mostly involved in mutagenicity and ecotoxicology studies. I also had a short stint in the Histopathology lab where I assisted in necropsy, processing and quality control of tissue slides.<br>
        After migrating to Australia I did my Cert 3 in Early Childhood education and worked as an educator for a year in an amazing centre in Sydney</p>
